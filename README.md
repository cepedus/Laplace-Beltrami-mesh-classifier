# Shape Comparison and Retrieval

*INF574 Digital Representation and Analysis of Shapes, Promotion X2017*

This project tries to implement the method described in [Rustamov2007](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~misha/Fall07/Papers/Rustamov07.pdf) to retrieve and classify shapes by computing a descriptor for deformable 3D shapes using the Laplace-Beltrami operator.

## Code

Only the source files are in this repository. The [dataset](http://people.csail.mit.edu/sumner/research/deftransfer/data.html) must be extracted to the `./models/` directory and you have to use CMake to generate the project files in the folder `./build/`
